   <b>Tag name:</b> &lt;tr:resetActionListener&gt;
   <br/>
<p>
          The resetActionListener tag is a declarative way to allow an action
          source (&lt;commandButton&gt;, &lt;commandLink&gt;, etc.) to fire a
          reset action. All values submitted will be reset to null or empty.
          The reset will not alter any model state directly, rather the
          enclosing action should have its own actionListener which will reset
          all model values to their defaults. The resetActionListener tag
          supports no attributes.
         </p><h4>Example:</h4><p>
           This example shows a "Reset..." button. When the button is pressed,
           the all elements on the form will be reset before being applied. The
           resetModel actionListener will also be called.
