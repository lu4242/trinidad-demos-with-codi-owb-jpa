   <b>Tag name:</b> &lt;tr:fileDownloadActionListener&gt;
   <br/>
<p>

        The fileDownloadActionListener tag is a declarative way to allow an
        action source (&lt;commandButton&gt;, &lt;commandLink&gt;,
        etc.) to programatically send the contents of a file to the user,
        optionally with a specific content type and filename.

</p><h4>Example:</h4><p>

           This example sends a simple "Hello there!" file to the user.
          </p><source>
            &lt;h:commandButton value="Say Hello"&gt;
              &lt;tr:fileDownloadActionListener filename="hello.txt"
                                        contentType="text/plain; charset=utf-8"
                                        method="#{bean.sayHello}"/&gt;
            &lt;/h:commandButton&gt;</source><source>
    public void sayHello(FacesContext context, OutputStream out) throws IOException
    {
      OutputStreamWriter w = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");
      w.write("Hi there!");
      // The stream is automatically closed, but since we wrapped it,
      // we'd better flush our writer
      w.flush();
    }</source>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Supports EL?</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>contentType</td><td>Object</td><td>Yes</td><td>

          the MIME type of the file, for example text/plain, text/csv, application/pdf, etc.
        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>filename</td><td>Object</td><td>Yes</td><td>

          the proposed filename for the object.  When set, a "Save File"
dialog will typically be displayed, though this is ultimately up to
the browser.  If not set, the content will typically be displayed inline in the
browser if possible.
        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>method</td><td>Object</td><td>Only EL</td><td>

          the method that will be used to download the file contents.
The method takes two arguments, a FacesContext and an OutputStream.
The OutputStream will be automatically closed, so the sole responsibility
of this method is to write all bytes to the OutputStream.
