   The immediate children of a Table component must all be &lt;tr:column&gt; components. Each visible Trinidad Column component creates a separate column in the Table. "/>

    <br/>

    The child components of each Column display the data for each row in that column.
    The Column does not create child components per row; instead, each child is repeatedly rendered (stamped) once
    per row. Because of this stamping behavior, only certain types of components are supported as children inside a
    Column. Supported components include all components with no behavior and most components that implement the
    EditableValueHolder or ActionSource interfaces.

    <tr:spacer height="12px"/>

    <tr:outputText value="As each row is stamped, the data for the current row ( see getRowData() on the Table) is
        copied into an EL reachable property. The name of this property is defined by the var  property on the Table.
        Once the Table has completed rendering, this property is removed (or reverted back to its previous value).
        In the following example, the data for each row is placed under the EL property &quot;row&quot;. "/>
