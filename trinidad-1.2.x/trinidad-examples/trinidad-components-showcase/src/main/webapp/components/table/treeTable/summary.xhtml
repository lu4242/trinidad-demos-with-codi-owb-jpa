    The Trinidad TreeTable is used to display data that is structured in a hierarchical format.
    This component displays a hierarchy in a UI similar to an Trinidad Table, and is more elaborate than the Tree
    component. TreeTable supports displaying columns of data per element in the hierarchy. Unlike the Tree component,
    TreeTable only supports single rooted hierarchies. The features of the TreeTable component include mechanisms
    for focusing in on subtrees (within the main tree), as well as expanding and collapsing elements in the hierarchy.

    <br/>

    Like the Table, the TreeTable's children must be Trinidad Column components. Like the Tree,
    the TreeTable has a &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet which renders the &quot;Object Name&quot; Column. The
    &quot;Object Name&quot; Column contains the primary identifier of an element in the hierarchy. For example,
    in an organization chart of employees, the &quot;Object Name&quot; Column might be the employee name.
