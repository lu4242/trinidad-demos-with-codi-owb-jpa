    The selectOrderShuttle component provides a mechanism for selecting multiple values from
    a list of values by allowing the user to move items between two lists, and reordering that list of values.
    It includes all the functionality of selectManyShuttle, and has an equivalent API. The only functional
    difference is that selectOrderShuttle will present the user with the ability to reorder the list of selected
    values, and will deliver ValueChangeEvents when the order changes. (selectMany components do not consider
    changes in order relevant to the value of that component.) See the documentation for selectManyShuttle for
    further information on using the shuttle.
