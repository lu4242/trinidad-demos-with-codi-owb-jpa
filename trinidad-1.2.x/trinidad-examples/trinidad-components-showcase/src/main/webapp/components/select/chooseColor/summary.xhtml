    The chooseColor control creates a palette for picking colors. A chooseColor can display two sets of colors: 

    <tr:panelList >
        <tr:outputText value="A set of standard colors, as specified by the colorData attribute."/>
        <tr:outputText value="A set of custom colors which extend the set of colors available in the standard palette.
            Custom colors are specified by the customColorData attribute."/>
    </tr:panelList>

    <tr:spacer height="12px"/>

    <tr:outputText value="Both the colorData and customColorData attributes accept both List and array objects,
        each of which contain one java.awt.Color instance for each color to display. "/>
