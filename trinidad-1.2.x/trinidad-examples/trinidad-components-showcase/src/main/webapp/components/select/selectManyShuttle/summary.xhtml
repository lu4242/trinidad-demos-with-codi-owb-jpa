    The selectManyShuttle component provides a mechanism for selecting multiple values from a
    list of values by allowing the user to move items between two lists. The &quot;value&quot; attribute of the
    selectManyShuttle, like any other selectMany component, must be a List or array of values that correspond to a
    value of one of the contained SelectItems. If a value of one of the SelectItems is in the List or array, that
    item will appear in the trailing list. Looked at another way, you can change a selectManyListbox directly into
    a selectManyShuttle; instead of the &quot;value&quot; driving which items are selected in the listbox, it
    affects which items appear in the trailing list of the shuttle.

    <tr:outputText value="The selectManyShuttle does not allow for reordering; the selectOrderShuttle component
        adds this functionality to selectManyShuttle. selectManyShuttle also does not include automatic messaging
        support, unlike most other Trinidad messaging components.  "/>
