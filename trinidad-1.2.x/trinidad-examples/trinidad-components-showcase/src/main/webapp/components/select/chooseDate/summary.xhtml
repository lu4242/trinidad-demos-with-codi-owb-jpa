    The chooseDate component is used in conjunction with a selectInputDate to allow the user
    to quickly select a date value without having to navigate to a secondary window. The chooseDate is typically
    used for tasks where selecting a date value is a critical part of the task flow. Instead of requiring the user
    to select the date from a secondary window, a chooseDate can be displayed inline in the page contents. Users can
    then select a date directly within the chooseDate, which will cause the currently focused selectInputDate to be
    updated with the selected date.

        the associated chooseDate component. "/>

        component will not be rendered. Instead, the selectInputDate may provide access to a date picker in a secondary
        window to facilitate date selection. "/>
