    The group component is an invisible control that aggregates semantically-related children;
    the group itself has no associated client representation (visual or API). Some parent components may have
    special representation for groups like adding separators around the group but this is a special case and is
    not always rendered this way. In most cases, only the children of the group will be rendered directly to
    the page. There will be no layout applied to the children so the natural layout behavior of the underlying HTML
    elements will apply. If you require a more predictable layout, you should use a layout component such as
    panelGroupLayout.
