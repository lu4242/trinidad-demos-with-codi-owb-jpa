    This component lays out a label, children, tip, and associated message. Typically, the
    only child of this component will be an input element of some sort, but as many children as necessary can be
    added. When using panelLabelAndMessage with a Trinidad input component, you should always  set
    simple=&quot;true&quot; on the input component. Non-simple Trinidad input components already effectively have
    all the functionality of panelLabelAndMessage.

    <tr:outputText value="Note that the label and messages that are rendered only apply to the &quot;for&quot;
        component so messages and labels will not be shown if there are multiple input child components.  "/>

    <tr:outputText value="To lay out multiple panelLabelAndMessage components - or multiple non-simple Trinidad
        input components - you can use the panelForm component. When panelLabelAndMessage components are placed inside
        a panelForm the labels will line up. "/>
