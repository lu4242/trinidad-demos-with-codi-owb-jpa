    The panelBox is used to place ancillary information on a page, offset by a certain color.

    <br/>

    There are four possible attributes to set for the content container. The width of the
    container can be set to either an exact pixel size or a percentage of the element the content container is
    within. This is done by using the inlineStyle or styleClass attributes.

    <br/>

    Content containers can have headers and icons. Set the text and icon attributes to gain
    these items. If neither is set, the content container will only display its children. If there is a header but
    no icon, the header will show and the content will be offset to line up with the start of the header. If an
    icon is set, the icon will appear to the left of the header, but the content will still be offset to the left
    of the header. If an icon is set but no header, the icon will still be displayed on the left but no header text
    will be visible.

        background attribute. The values for the background attribute are light, medium, dark, and transparent. The

        title bar. "/>
