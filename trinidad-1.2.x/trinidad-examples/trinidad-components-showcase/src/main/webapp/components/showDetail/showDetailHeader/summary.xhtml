    The showDetailHeader provides a means of toggling the contents under a header between being disclosed(shown) or undisclosed(hidden).

    <br/>

    On mobile devices the showDetailHeader renders nothing itself, but does render its children.

    <br/>

    If the &quot;disclosed&quot; property on the showDetailHeader is set to false, the icon
    arrow will point sideways, and the children of the showDetailHeader will not be rendered. If the
    &quot;disclosed&quot; property of the showDetailHeader is set to true, the icon arrow will point down and the
    children of the showDetailHeader will be rendered.

    <tr:spacer height="12px"/>

    <tr:outputText
        value="Clicking on the icon of the showDetailHeader will deliver a DisclosureEvent to the server. "/>
