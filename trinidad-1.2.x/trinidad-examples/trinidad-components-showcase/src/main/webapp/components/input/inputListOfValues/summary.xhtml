    The inputListOfValues is a text field that also supports launching a dialog to assist
    users in entering a value. The dialog to use is specified via the &quot;action&quot; attribute, which should
    use the &quot;dialog:*&quot; syntax. The inputListOfValues will automatically be populated using the return
    value of the dialog; see the document on Processes and Dialogs for more information about writing dialogs.
    (If the user's device does not support secondary windows, the &quot;dialog&quot; will be shown in the same window.)
