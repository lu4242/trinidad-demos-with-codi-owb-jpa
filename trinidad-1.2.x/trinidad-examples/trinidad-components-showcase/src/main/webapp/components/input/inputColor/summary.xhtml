    The inputColor component creates a text field for entering colors. Users can specify
    color values in one of three ways, depending on how the inputColor component is configured.

    <tr:panelList>
        <tr:outputText value="Users can type the color value directly in the field. This option is always available."/>
        <tr:outputText value="Users can select a color value from a secondary dialog. This option may not be
            available in all look and feel implementations. In particular, this option is not available on PDA look and feels."/>
        <tr:outputText value="Users can select a color value from an inline chooseColor component. In order to
            enable this option, the chooseColor must be placed in the same page as the inputColor, and the inputColor's
            paletteId attribute must be set to the id of the corresponding chooseColor. Again, this option is not
            supported on PDA look and feel."/>
