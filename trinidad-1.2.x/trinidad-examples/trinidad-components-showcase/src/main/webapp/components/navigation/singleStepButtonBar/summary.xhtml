    SingleStepButtonBar renders a Previous button, text indicating the current step and the
    maximum steps, and a Next button. SingleStepButtonBar is used to navigate forward and back in a series of steps,
    like steps in a checkout process. 

    <br/>

    SingleStepButtonBar implements javax.faces.component.ActionSource, which means it is a source of javax.faces.event.ActionEvent's.

    <tr:outputText value="The ActionEvent is delivered during the Apply Request Values phase when navigating back,
        and during the Invoke Application phase when navigating forward. "/>

    <tr:outputText value="The nextAction/previousAction attributes are of type MethodBinding and must (if non-null)
        point to an action method. The nextAction method will be called when navigating forward, and the previousAction
        method will be called when navigating back with a singleStep component. "/>

    <tr:outputText value="JSF has a default javax.faces.event.ActionListener that passes the nextAction or

    <tr:outputText value="The nextActionListener/previousActionListener attributes are of type MethodBinding and

        nextActionListener method is called. "/>
