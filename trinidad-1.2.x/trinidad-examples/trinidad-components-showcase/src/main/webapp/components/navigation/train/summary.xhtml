    Train is a UIXProcess component that renders a train. A train is a horizontal series of
    train stations connected by a horizontal line. Each train station is an image and text describing the page in
    the multi-page process.

    <br/>

    The train takes a model of type org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.MenuModel. The last node along the focusPath and its siblings are rendered
