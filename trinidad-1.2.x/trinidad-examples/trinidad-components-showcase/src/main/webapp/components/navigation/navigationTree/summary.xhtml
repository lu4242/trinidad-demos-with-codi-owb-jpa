    The navigationTree is used to display navigation data that is structured in a hierarchical
    format. The features of the Tree component include mechanisms for expanding and collapsing portions of the
    hierarchy. The focus path of the navigationTree is visually indicated and by default the nodes along the focus
    path are added to the expandedRowKeys pathSet.

    <tr:outputText value="The &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet of the navigationTree is used to render the data for each
        node in the tree. The &quot;nodeStamp&quot; is repeatedly rendered (stamped) once per node"/>
