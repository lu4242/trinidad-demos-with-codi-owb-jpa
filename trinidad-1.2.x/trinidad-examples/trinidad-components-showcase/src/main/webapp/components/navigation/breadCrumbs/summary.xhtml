    A breadCrumbs component is used in hierarchical site layouts to indicate the path back to
    the root page of the hierarchy with links. A child representing the current page should be the last child. This
    child may or may not be rendered depending on variables like the device type or look and feel, but it should
    always be added.

    <br/>

    <tr:outputText value="The links indicating the hierarchy may be added as children or a menu model may be bound
        to the breadCrumbs component. If a menu model is bound, of class org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.MenuModel,
        the nodes along the focus path will be rendered."/>

    <tr:spacer height="12px"/>

    <tr:outputText value="MenuModel extends TreeModel, but it also knows how to go from the current viewId to the
        focus path. Notice that the menuModel has no special knowledge of page navigation and places no requirements on
        the nodes that go into the tree. The nodes in the tree are stamped out with the 'nodeStamp' facet, which should
        contain a commandNavigationItem component, which allows the default actionListener mechanism to be used for page
        navigation."/>

    <tr:outputText value="The &quot;orientation&quot; property may be used to specify the orientation of the
        breadCrumbs. If the orientation is &quot;horizontal&quot;, successive links will be put on the same line. If the
        orientation is &quot;vertical&quot;, successive links will be put on a new line, and indented from their parents.
        In most cases, the orientation should be horizontal. A vertical breadCrumbs should be used only when the text
        for the links is known to be very long and likely to cause undesirable scrolling. The default value is
        horizontal.  -  HORIZONTAL"/>
