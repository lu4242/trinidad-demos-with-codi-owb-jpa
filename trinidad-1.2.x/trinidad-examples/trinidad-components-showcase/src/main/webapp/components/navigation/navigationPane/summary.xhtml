    The navigationPane component creates a series of navigation items representing one level
    in a navigation hierarchy. These items may either be added as children or a menu model may be bound to the
    navigationPane component. If a menu model is bound, of class org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.XMLMenuModel or
    org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.MenuModel, a level along the focus path, or the next level down, will be
    rendered. A node that is on the focus path will be rendered as &quot;selected&quot;

    <tr:spacer height="12px"/>

    <tr:outputText value="The &quot;level&quot; attribute is temporary. It is used to indicate the level along the
        focusPath to render. It will likely be replaced with an el expression in a future release."/>

    <tr:outputText value="XMLMenuModel extends TreeModel, but it also knows how to go from the current viewId to the
        focus path. Notice that the xmlMenuModel has no special knowledge of page navigation and places no requirements
        on the nodes that go into the tree. The nodes in the tree are stamped out with the 'nodeStamp' facet, which
        should contain a commandNavigationItem component, which allows the default actionListener mechanism to be used
        for page navigation. "/>
