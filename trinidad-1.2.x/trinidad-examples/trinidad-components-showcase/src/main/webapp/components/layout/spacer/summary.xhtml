    pacer occupies a fixed amount of space in a layout, specified by its width and height
    attributes. If the width is not specified, but height specified, a block level HTML element is rendered,
    thereby introducing a new line effect. If width is specified, then, irrespective of the specified
    value of height, it may not get shorter than the applicable line-height, in user agents that strictly support
    standards mode HTML.
