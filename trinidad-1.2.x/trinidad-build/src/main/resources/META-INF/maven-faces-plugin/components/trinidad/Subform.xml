      <mfp:long-description><![CDATA[UIXSubform is the base abstraction for an independently submittable
region of a page.  The contents of a subform will only be validated
(or otherwise processed) if a component inside of the subform is
responsible for submitting the page.  This allows for comparatively
fine-grained control of which components will be validated and pushed
into the model without the compromises of using entirely separate form
elements.  UIXSubform is a <html:code>NamingContainer</html:code> and
therefore IDs can be reused between subforms.

<section name="Behavior of subforms">
<html:p>
A <html:code>UIXSubform</html:code> is considered &quot;submitted&quot; if an
event is queued by one of its children or facets for a phase later
than &quot;Apply Request Values&quot; (that is, for later than
<html:code>decode()</html:code>).  The most common example is a
(non-immediate) &quot;command&quot; component (like an &lt;h:commandButton&gt;
or &lt;tr:commandButton&gt;).
</html:p>
<html:p>
A <html:code>UIXSubform</html:code> will always allow the
&quot;Apply Request Values&quot; phase to execute for its children,
even when not &quot;submitted&quot;, but when not &quot;submitted&quot;, the
&quot;Process Validations&quot; and &quot;Update Model Values&quot; phases will
be skipped.  This differs from an ordinary form component,
which, when not submitted, does not (and cannot) run
&quot;Apply Request Values&quot; either.
</html:p>
</section>
<section name="UIXSubform and &quot;default&quot;">
<html:p>
In some scenarios, there may be buttons (or other components
that submit the page) outside of the main content of a page.  If
this main content is in a UIXSubform, it could not be fully
processed whenever those buttons are clicked, since those
buttons aren't inside of the UIXSubform.  To support this
scenario, Apache Trinidad supports a &quot;default&quot; property on
UIXSubform.  A &quot;default&quot; subform behaves like any other
subform in most respects, but if <html:em>no</html:em> subforms
are &quot;submitted&quot; - if no subform has an appropriate event
come from its children - then all &quot;default&quot; subforms act
as if they are &quot;submitted&quot;.
