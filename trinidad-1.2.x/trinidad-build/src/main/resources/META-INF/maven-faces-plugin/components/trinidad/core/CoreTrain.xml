        <![CDATA[Train is a UIXProcess component
        that renders a train. A train is a horizontal series of train
        stations connected by a horizontal line. Each train station is an
        image and text describing the page in the multi-page process.

        <section name="Model">
          The train takes a model of type
          <html:code>org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.MenuModel</html:code>. The
          last node along the focusPath and its siblings are rendered.
          <html:p>
          MenuModel extends TreeModel, but it also knows how to go from the
          current viewId to the focus path. Notice that the menuModel has no
          special knowledge of page navigation and places no requirements on
          the nodes that go into the tree. The nodes in the tree are stamped
          out with the 'nodeStamp' facet, which should contain a
          commandNavigationItem component, which allows the default
          actionListener mechanism to be used for page navigation.
          </html:p>
          <html:p>
          There are two common scenarios for processes, &quot;Plus One&quot;
          and &quot;Max Visited&quot; which are explained below.
            <html:ul>
              <html:li>&quot;Plus One&quot; - from the current step the user can
              navigate to any previous page and the next page. If the user is on
              the 5th step of a process and goes back to step 2, then the user
              can only navigate from step 2 to step 1 and step 3.
              </html:li>
              <html:li>&quot;Max Visited&quot; - the user can navigate to the max
              visited page. If the user is currently on the max visited page
              then the user can also navigate to the next page. If the user is
              on the 5th step of a process and goes back to step 2, then the
              user can navigate from step 2 to steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
              </html:li>
            </html:ul>

            The class <html:code>org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.ProcessMenuModel</html:code>
            and <html:code>org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.ProcessUtils</html:code>
            were created to support the &quot;Plus One&quot; and
            &quot;Max Visited&quot; scenarios. Please see the javadoc for these
            classes for more information.

            <html:p>
            When the focusPath is not focused on a top level node,
            images are rendered before and
            after the train to indicate that this train is
            part of a sub-process
