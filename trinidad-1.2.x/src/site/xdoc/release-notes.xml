<subsection name="Features">

<ul>
<li>Added tr:panelCaptionGroup component to render HTML fieldset/legend content groups.</li>
<li>A new addDomReplaceListener() method on the page Javascript
object lets a developer receive notification when DOM is
replaced by PPR.</li>
<li>A new "mode" attribute on tr:document and trh:html lets you force Trinidad to enable "quirks" mode or to a "strict" DTD.  By default, Trinidad still renders with a transitional DTD but with standards-mode rendering.  Note: "strict" mode does not currently change how Trinidad renders - it simply swaps the DTD.</li>
<li>The "toolbar" facet is now supported on showDetailItems in panelAccordion.</li>
<li>A new accessibility "profile" API has been added as a companion to the existing accessibility "mode".  The accessibility profile API provides support for finer-grained accessibility preferences than can be supported by a mode-based API.  The first two accessibility profile preferences are "high-contrast", for users who prefer high contrast styles/content, and "large-fonts", for users who prefer larger/scalable fonts.  The accessibility profile value can be specified/bound in trinidad-config.xml via the new &lt;accessibility-profile&gt; element.  Trinidad skinning has been enhanced to allow accessibility profile-specific styles/icons to be specified via within @accessibility-profile blocks.  Accessibility profile information can be accessed at runtime (eg. from within a Renderer) via the new RequestContext/RenderingContext.getAccessibilityProfile() APIs. </li>
</ul>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Changes from previous release">
<ul>
<li>In previous releases, @agent/@platform constrains in skin definitions were not applied to icons.  That is, icons which appeared within @agent/@platform objects were registered globally and were not constrained to any particular agent/platform.  This is no longer the case.  @agent/@platform constraints are now honored for both styles and icons, making it possible to define agent/platform-specific icons.
</li>
<li>In previous releases, when you change a skinning css file, the change is reflected 
in the running application on refresh. To aid in performance, this is now a configuration
option that defaults to false -- do not check for css file modifications.
The web.xml configuration parameter org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.CHECK_FILE_MODIFICATION 
is used. Set this to true if you want your skinning css file changes to be reflected
without stopping/starting the server.
</li>
<li>The style name for skinning the root of a panelAccordion has changed from "af|panelAccordion::container" to "af|panelAccordion".</li>
<li>The xOffset/yOffset attributes of panelPopup have been renamed to xoffset/yoffset.</li>
</ul>

<subsection name="Improvements">
<ul>
<li>Partial-page rendering should now be much more efficient, as
many portions of the page that are not being rerendered can be
skipped entirely.

<section name="Supported Platforms">


<p>Trinidad is currently supported on the following user agents.  We'd very
much like to add additional platforms to this list -  omission doesn't
mean it that it doesn't work, just that it hasn't been tested.
(NOTE: PDA support is definitely longer than just this list -
Blackberry support was recently added.  A separate table of 
PDA support should be added once that's been gathered.) </p>
